**Story:**  
There is a myth that if a penguin is willing to sacrifice everything and everyone then ultimate the power of flight will be the award. But no penguin has ever attempted it as penguins as a rule are devoted to their families and friends.
  
That is, until Pavlov the Penguin wants more out of life and he doesn’t care about the cost. He has left home but his loved ones may still try to convince him otherwise….
